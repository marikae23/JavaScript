## Basic Program
You will learn how to develop your first JS script, is easy and enjoyable. However, there are caveats and difficulties everywhere, so we will also look at some common programming errors and how to avoid them.

```ruby
console.log("Hello, World!");
```
**Explanation!** Here `console.log` is a function & `"Hello, World!"` is a string.

> [!NOTE]
>  ㅠ ㅠ If you want to include quotes in a string, there are two ways to avoid confusion and successfully print them:
>```ruby
> console.log('Yes, I\'m ready to learn JS.');
>```

## Multi-line Programs
The following code prints exactly three lines of text, each from a new line:

```ruby
console.log("I");
console.log("know");
console.log("JavaScript");
```

**Easiest way** to do is using the symbol \n:
```ruby
console.log("I\nknow\nJavaScript");
```

## Empty Line
The `console.log` function also allows you to output an empty line without any information in it:

```ruby
console.log("I");
console.log();
console.log("know");
console.log();
console.log("JavaScript");
```
